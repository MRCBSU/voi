Description: Methods to calculate the expected value of information from a decision-analytic model.  This includes the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), partial perfect information (EVPPI) and sample information (EVSI), and the expected net benefit of sampling (ENBS).  A range of alternative computational methods are provided under the same user interface.
