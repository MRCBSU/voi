## voi package TODO

* Copy in existing EVPPI code

* Copy in existing EVSI code from Convoi 1 material

* Work out how to separate costs, effects, and willingness to pay in NB.  How do other packages do it?  I'd like the package not to be completely specific to health economic decision models, so should allow the option of supplying a generic NB that isn't a function of costs and effects.
